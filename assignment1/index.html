            <h3>Future goals, Visions and personal philosophy</h3>
            <p>I presently work as a healthcare practitioner and for the past 10
                years have been in this discipline.<br>However, I have always had
                a desire and hunger for engineering. Few years ago I decided to pursue
                a career change but at that time had no idea on how to execute it.
                While I was on holiday in the fall of 2024, my younger brother had
                introduced me to the AltSchool twitter page. I had a look and decided to
                to enroll for the <abbr title="SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING">SOE</abbr>.<br>
                The journey as i had imagined has not been easy but nonetheless exciting.
                My goals within the AltSchool program are numerous but numerated below:
            <ul class="list2">
                <li>Successfully complate my program and become a fully skilled cloud engineer.</li>
                <li>Graduate with the highest necesssary skills intended for.</li>
                <li>Meet like minded individuals while on the program, connect and inspire
                    ech other to create opportunities in the future.
                </li>
                <li>Independently practice as a cloud engineer while contributing my
                    skills for collaborative building.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Ultimately, my vision is to make a lasting impact in the world of software engineeringâ€”pioneering
            advancements that not only push the boundaries of technology
            but also contribute to a more just and equitable future.
